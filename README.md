## Introduction

The goal of this project is to:
1. Analyze historical temperature data in India from 1901 to 2017.
2. Visualize temperature trends over time.
3. Forecast temperatures for the year 2018 using a Decision Tree Regressor.
4. Save the forecasted data and visualize the results.

The project uses Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `plotly`, and `scikit-learn` for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is **"Weather Data in India from 1901 to 2017"**, which contains monthly temperature data for each year from 1901 to 2017. The dataset is available in CSV format.

Dataset Columns:
- `YEAR`: The year of the recorded data.
- `JAN`, `FEB`, `MAR`, ..., `DEC`: Monthly temperature data for each year.
